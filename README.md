Practice creating REST API with Flask, Connexion, and SQLAlchemy by completing a tutorial series provided by Real Python

Why: I want to learn different ways to create REST APIs in Python. Hopefully, this will come in handy when building my own projects.

Part One:
  - Build a base Flask project with a REST API
  - Handle HTTP requests with Connexion
  - Define API endpoints using the OpenAPI specification
  - Interact with your API to manage data
  - Build API documentation with Swagger UI

What I enjoyed: Implementing Swagger UI into a project
I have seen Swagger UI in action in others' projects or already done apply to a bootcamp project, so to finally implement one from scratch and learn how 
to read its YAML file was a great experience.
